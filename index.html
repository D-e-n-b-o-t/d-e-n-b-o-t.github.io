        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>Curious.</p>
        <p>I search for answers where few question or ask, to make the world a better place.</p>
        <p>I always look for the truth regardless of whether I like the answer or not.</p>
        <p>I aim to be independent of others and rely only on myself so I can teach others.</p>
        <p>I make mistakes and hope that others will point them out so I can improve.</p>
        <p>This is me. This is Denis.</p>
        <br>
          <p>OKAY, MAYBE THAT SOUNDED TOO SERIOUS HAHA.</p>
          <p>Look, I'm just a guy who likes to try things out. 
          One day it might be learning morse code, the next it might 
          be creating a startup. Whatever comes to mind - if it is interesting, I will learn it. And because I do what I do - people define me by different titles. 
          </p>
          <p>Programmer, lover, traveller, author, wine maker, gym bro, friend... There's not really a single box that fits them all.</p>
          <p>Now, I do have my strenghts by being hands-on technical. But that means that there are some areas I lack when it comes to being social.</p>
          <p>I don't like big cities, crowds and dogs. Very unpredictable.</p>
          <p>But what I do like is intimate connections between two people. So this is why I wrote a book - to bring people closer together in a time where we are apart.</p>
          <br>
