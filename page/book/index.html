        <h2 id="here_s_the_gist">Here's the gist</h2>
        <p>Being involved with the pick-up community for over 9 years,
        I have decided to share what I've learned throughout those years.</p>
        <p>I wrote this book for only one purpose - to help boys get out of loneliness and mediocrity, as others have
        helped me.</p>
        <p>This is me returning the favor.</p>
        <h2 id="a_mentor_for_you_if_you_are_willing_to_change">A mentor for you if you are willing to change</h2>
        <p>The book is divided into three sections: Theory, Tactics and Strategy.</p>
        <p>The theory section explains the dating market from the point of evolutionary psychology.
          From mate selection to power dynamics, this section will teach you the rules of the game,
          how to avoid certain pitfalls and why nice guys hardly ever get laid.
        By finishing this section, you will understand the playing field like never before.</p>
        <p>The tactics section is all about you and what you can do to improve your chances on the playing field.
          Discipline, confidence, overcoming genetic disadvantages, style, fitness, diet, making money short-term and long-term - you will be provided with practical steps which you can take.
        By finishing this section, you will have a long term blueprint for improving yourself.</p>
        <p>The strategy section is all about women. How to approach them, how to talk to women (or rather
          how to make her talk), what to text before a date, when and where to take her on a date, how to lead,
          how to read social q's, good and bad signals,
          how to take her home, how to get intimate on dates and in the bedroom, picking-up women in different social situations, how to choose a partner for a long-term relationship.
        By finishing this section, you will have all the instructions on how to get laid like a warlord and have healthy long-term relationships.</p>
        <h2 id="available_languages_and_formats">Available languages and formats</h2>
        <p>Currently it is <strong>only available in Lithuanian</strong> but an English translation is coming soon. </p>
        <p>The book is available in two formats: paperback and as an eBook as PDF or ePub.</p>
        <h2 id="where_can_i_find_this_book">Where can I find this book?</h2>
        <p>The book has its own <a target='_blank' href="https://meileszaidimas.lt">official website</a>.</p>
        <p>You can also find the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Denis-Lisunov-ebook/dp/B0BC1BTLCK">eBook version on Amazon</a>.</p>

        <p>For now, I only ship to Lithuania though. The final price is 9.69 Euros (this includes shipping costs).</p>
